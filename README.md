PipelineML GeoPackager is a [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/) [plugin](https://plugins.qgis.org/) that reads a [PipelineML](https://pipelineml.org/) file and translates its contents into a [GeoPackage](https://www.geopackage.org/).  This allows QGIS to natively consume and store PipelineML data for GIS analysis, and demonstrates the ability for PipelineML to be implemented in a fully open architecture.
